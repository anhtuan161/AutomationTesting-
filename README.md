# Automation Testing tips

Sharing &amp; noted some tips when using Automation Frameworks (Selenium, Appium, v.v )

## Getting Started

These are some tips to help you work with Automation Testing Project (Web testing, mobile testing on Android & IOS). Sharing my little experience in some projects that my team worked before.

Note for myself to remember & note my stupid mistakes :)

### Reading

Some documents & tips:

[Improving Application Speed and Quality](https://dzone.com/guides/automated-testing-improving-application-speed-and).

### Mobile's XPath
Documents: [Refer](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/#section-Location-Steps)

Not recommend to get Mobile's element by Xpath. Because it's will impact to performance when we run mobile's script. Specially, we can see more clearly when run on IOS's scripts using Appium.

Example 1
```
//parentnode/Employee[@name='<name>' and @DOB='<dateofbirth>']
//XCUIElementTypeButton[contains(@name,'Edit')]
```
Updating..

### Web Application's XPath

Example 1: Get element whose type is "shingles", but only if the manufacturer is "Nash"
```
 <roofing-material> 

         <manufacturer>Nash</manufacturer> 

         <type>shingles</type> 

      </roofing-material> 
```
```
//roofing-material[type="shingles"][manufacturer="Nash"] 

//roofing-material[type="shingles" and manufacturer="Nash"] 

//roofing-material[type[preceding-sibling::manufacturer="Nash"]="shingles"]
```

Example 2:
```
  <tosses> 

      <toss result="heads"/> 

      <toss result="heads"/> 

      <toss result="tails"/> 

      <toss result="heads"/> 

   </tosses>
```
```
(//toss)[@result="heads"][3] - Correct

(//toss)[3][@result="heads"] - Returns an empty node-set
```
